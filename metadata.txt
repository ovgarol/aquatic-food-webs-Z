opt: optimal prey size in microns
group: predator feeding group (PFG)
type: type of predator
source: reference of the register 
kingdom: the kingdom of the predator
phylum: phylum of the predator
class: class of the predator
order: order of the predator
family: family of the predator
genus: genus of the predator

Metadata for WORMS_names_taxonomy.csv
This file includes the taxonomy of aquatic predators.
It is identical to the JSON metadata of WORMS (https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=manual) with the addition of the field name, which connects to the file database.csv.

Metadata for minimal_model.csv
This file includes size limits of feeding guilds extracted from data.
COLUMNS:
group: predator feeding group (PFG)
type: type of predator
min.esd: minimum body size of the predator in microns
max.esd: maximum body size of the predator in microns
s: specialization factor calculated for the feeding guild
color: indexed color for plotting purposes
lty: indexed line type for plotting purposes
